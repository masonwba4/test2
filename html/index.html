      <h2>Formation and Early Years</h2>
      <p>
        Oasis was formed in Manchester, England, in 1991 by brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher.
        The band started by performing in small venues and gained attention with their energetic performances
        and catchy songwriting. Their style drew heavily on classic rock influences, including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.

      <h2>Rise to Fame</h2>
      <p>
        The release of their debut album, <strong>Definitely Maybe</strong> in 1994, quickly established Oasis as
        one of the leading bands of the Britpop movement. The follow-up, <strong>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</strong> in 1995,
        became a worldwide success, featuring hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger."

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Oasis is widely regarded as one of the most influential British rock bands of the 1990s.
        Their anthemic songs, outspoken personalities, and Britpop rivalry with bands like Blur
        left a lasting mark on music culture. Even after their breakup, both Noel and Liam
        continue to produce music in their respective solo projects.
